DingMe
======

DingMe! Is a great way to Gain Skills, Follow tasks, and Get Motivated.

Why? Because the Flesh is Week, but the Bar is strong. 

What is the Bar?

The Bar is life. The Bar is death. The bar is progression from Zero to One. 

There is none but the completion of the bar, hairless ape. 

Using DingMe, (Working name), you can create a goal for yourself, and a series of objectives for reaching that goal. Once you're set... You Summon the Bar. 

The Bar starts at 5%? Why? Because you've already done the first step. You've brought the glory of the bar into your life. 

Now, when you accomplish objectives, just mark that you've completed them, and the bar will shudder to life. You will see your progress. The bar, will, move, you. 

And when you are done, you can share the Quest you just undertook with the world, spreading the light of your experience, and the majesty of the Bar.
